Project Requirements
2.
Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. 
In our example project, we documented the tags and attributes used in 
HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve 
learned so far—the sky is the limit!

Possible topics could be:

HTML Tables
Other HTML tags
CSS selectors and specificity
Common CSS properties
If you choose to document HTML tags, open the hint to see how to include HTML
 tags as text in your code.


Hint
When displaying HTML tag names as text, you can’t just use the < or > 
characters, since your browser will think you are trying to create an actual 
HTML tag. In order to show HTML tags as text, use &lt; to represent
 < and $gt; to represent >. 2 For example, including the following HTML:

&lt;h1&gt;
will render the following text:

<h1>


3.
Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label 
the columns in your HTML.

In our example site, we used tables with columns for:

The tag or attribute name
The actual formatted tag (eg. <table>)
A description of what to use the tag for.
You can use these same columns or choose your own.

4.
Your site should utilize a custom color scheme. You can use any of the named 
CSS colors.

5.
Your site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags (like <h1>) 
or CSS properties or values (like font-family). Represent code using a 
monospace font family and a different background color.
